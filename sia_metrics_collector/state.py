"""Represents a set of Sia metrics at a moment in time.

Note that the timestamp is *roughly* the time these metrics were collected.
It's accurate to within a few seconds, but shouldn't be trusted beyond that,
as different metrics come from different API calls made sequentially, each
with a small amount of latency.

Fields:
    timestamp: Time at which the metrics were collected.
    contract_count: Number of active Sia contracts.
    total_contract_size: Total size of all Sia contracts (this should be
        equal to uploaded_bytes, but the data come from different
        sources).
    file_count: Number of files known to Sia (either partially or
        fully uploaded).
    total_file_bytes: Total size of all files files known to Sia. Not
        all bytes have necessarily been uploaded to Sia yet.
    uploads_in_progress_count: Number of uploads currently in progress.
    uploaded_bytes: Total number of bytes that have been uploaded
        across all files.
    total_contract_spending: Total amount of money (in hastings) spent
        on storage contracts.
    contract_fee_spending: Total amount of money (in hastings) spent on
        contract fees.
    storage_spending: Total amount of money (in hastings) spent on
        storage.
    upload_spending: Total amount of money (in hastings) spent on upload
        bandwidth.
    download_spending: Total amount of money (in hastings) spent on
        download bandwidth.
    wallet_siacoin_balance: Current wallet balance of Siacoins (in
        hastings).
    wallet_outgoing_siacoins: Unconfirmed outgoing Siacoins (in hastings).
    wallet_incoming_siacoins: Unconfirmed incoming Siacoins (in hastings).
    api_latency: Time (in milliseconds) it took for Sia to respond to
        all API calls.
